# Running IRI and plotting the EDP results

* IRI: the [International Reference Ionosphere](https://irimodel.org/) model
* EDP: electron density profile

Instructed to use IRI-2020 (12/20/2024), but the current IRI-2020 is dated 03/20/2025.
The Wayback Machine has the previous version:
<https://web.archive.org/web/20250215171731/https://irimodel.org/IRI-2020/>.
Unforunately, `00_iri.zip` wasn't archived,
and essential files like [`irifun.for`](https://web.archive.org/web/20250215171731/https://irimodel.org/IRI-2020/irifun.for)
seem to have been incompletely captured,
so I elected to use the current IRI-2020.
